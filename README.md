A comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 7043 customer records and 21 features [6], forms the basis of our investigation. Leveraging a Python-based approach, we explore various machine-learning algorithms to develop predictive models. Among the algorithms tested, the Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) Classifier emerges as the most effective, achieving an impressive accuracy score of 81%. Additionally, our study incorporates Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, KNN, Ada Boost Classifier, Gradient Boosting, XGB Classifier, and Neural Networks to comprehensively evaluate performance.
